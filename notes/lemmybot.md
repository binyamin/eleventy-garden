I want to set up a Lemmy bot to create match threads. I think there is a pretty good set of projects out-and-about that are for long-running processes, but I think I want to find a way to make a free-as-in-beer bot. Looks like oracle's [Always Free Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm) would be the best place to host this.
