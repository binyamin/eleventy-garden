# FAQ

**Q**: Can I have subfolders in my notes?\
**A**: ~~Of course! Remember to link to the subfolder, like `[[ subfolder/note ]]`~~. Currently, backlinks won't appear, due to a bug (See [#41](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/issues/41)) 😞.

**Q**: How do I update the template to the latest version?\
**A**: Refer to [[sync|Syncing your Template]]

**Q**: Is it possible to store notes without publishing them?\
**A**: Yep. Put those notes in a folder called `_drafts/`
