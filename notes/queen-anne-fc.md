title: Queen Anne FC
---

I think it would be fun and interesting to have a [USL W](https://www.uslwleague.com/) team that would play in Memorial Stadium starting Spring 2026.

## Name

I would call it Queen Anne FC. I like this name because it

- has the same queen vibe as the reign
- memorial stadium is in queen anne
- its a queen which is empowering for women I hope

## Player Pool

USL W is a pre-professional league, so players cannot be paid salaries. Players are "elite youth players, collegiate players, aspiring professionals, and former professionals." which means that we could tap

- [University of Washington](https://gohuskies.com/sports/womens-soccer)
- [Seattle University](https://goseattleu.com/sports/womens-soccer)
- [SPU](https://spufalcons.com/sports/womens-soccer)
- [Puget Sound](https://loggerathletics.com/sports/womens-soccer)
- Former Reign players

## Governance

It would be fun to start the club as a community-owned club, governed under [a constitution](https://thedonstrust.org/constitution/), and registered as a non-profit organization, like the Green Bay Packers.
