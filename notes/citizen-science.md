# Citizen Science

I think it would be very fun to make an dedicated to conducting and sharing the results of citizen science.

## How does it work?

Let's consider a simple experiment -- are people happier later in the day? First, Eric Experimenter would come to Citizen Science to design an experimenter. Eric decides on a design where Polly Participant will take a questionnaire once a day at a random time.

Once Eric Experimenter has finalized his design, he submits it to the platform for participatipant selection. Eric spends 20 "tokens" which he has purchased, or earned by partipating in studies to get 20 data points in his study.

Polly Participant enrolls in Eric's experiment. She has her own study where she wants participants to take pictures of the night sky and is trying to earn "credits". Polly fills out the survey 5 times over the next 5 days as one participant in a 4 person study.

Eric receives the results with early analysis performed on his behalf. This analysis, and any other additional analysis Eric performs is publicly shared on Citizen Science.

## Use Cases

- As a child, I want to recruit participants in my science fair project. I open Citizen Science and design an experiment and submit it to the platform, which finds participants and has them run the experiment.
- As a curious person, I would like to browse Citizen Science results to find experiments related to my area of inquiry.
- As an experimenter, I would like to reproduce the findings of previous experiments.
- As a Citizen Scientist, I want to be able to track and catalog data as results to experiments.
