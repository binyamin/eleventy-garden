## :seedling: Introduction

#### What is a digital garden?

A digital garden is a website where the primary organization of content emerges from contextual hyperlinks moreso than a chronological method of organization. It's a mix of a notebook and a blog, and often uses the ethos of "working in public."

#### Why use a mind garden?

Good way of presenting your own personal knowledge and understanding of things, as well as connecting them back and to each other, etc. A digital garden is a fun way to non-linearly represent all the things you care about on the web. Check out these great examples of mind gardens:
